/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for slope calculations. Each calculation is associated with a specific user, who has full CRUD access.
 * @data_structure All slope calculations are stored in the `/slope_calculations/{slopeCalculationId}` collection.  Each document includes a `userId` field indicating the owner.
 * @key_security_decisions Users can only access calculations they own. Listing all slope calculations is not allowed. Data shape validation is relaxed for prototyping.
 * @denormalization The `userId` field is denormalized directly onto each `slope_calculation` document to avoid needing to perform costly `get()` operations to check ownership.
 * @structural_segregation All slope calculation data is stored under a single collection `/slope_calculations/{slopeCalculationId}`.
